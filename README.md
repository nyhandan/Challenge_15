## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  - The vehicle_length and ground_clearance have p-vaules under .05, indicating that they most likely provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
  - The p-Value for this model is much smaller than thesignificance level of 0.05%. This means there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, so the linear model will not be zero.
  - The r-squared value is around 0.7149, so there is moderate-to-strong correlation between the input and output variables. So, this linear model most likely predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
This design specification of variance within 100 pounds per square inch is not met in all the manufacturing lots. Lot 1 has a variance of 0.9795918, Lot 2 has a variance of 7.4693878, and Lot 3 has a variance of 170.2861224. So, Lots 1 & 2 meet the requirement, but Lot 3 does not. For all the lots, the requirement is not met, but it is for the first 2.
